That said, you could refine it slightly for rhythm and impact. Here are two polished versions,
depending on what feel you want:

1. Minimal and professional (good for a GDD or webpage tagline):

Alibi is a deduction game where you investigate crime scenes and uncover the truth.
Can you piece together the evidence and solve the case?

2. Atmospheric and marketing-friendly (for a trailer or pitch deck):

Alibi is a narrative deduction game that puts you at the heart of crime scene investigations.
Study the clues, reconstruct the events, and uncover what really happened.

Your original is already solid — the only small adjustment I’d suggest is replacing “take part in uncovering”
with something more direct like “investigate” or “uncover”, since it keeps the sentence tighter and stronger
in tone.

==================

Excellent — that addition gives your pitch much more substance and helps potential readers grasp what sets
Alibi apart. Here are a few refined versions that integrate both key mechanics while keeping the language
natural and professional.

Option 1 — Balanced and professional (good for a Game Design Document or press kit):

Alibi is a deduction game where players investigate crime scenes by building an evolving
information matrix that captures what the investigators know. Using this growing web of facts,
the player reconstructs the chain of events — filling in the missing pieces to reveal what truly happened.

Option 2 — More narrative and engaging (for a trailer or public pitch):

In Alibi, every clue matters. As you investigate each case, your knowledge forms an expanding
information matrix that tracks what the detectives know. Use it to piece together the chain of events,
filling in the blanks to uncover the truth behind every crime.

Option 3 — Short tagline + expanded blurb (for your document header):

Tagline: Every clue connects. Every gap tells a story.

Pitch: Alibi is a narrative deduction game built around two core systems: an information matrix that grows
with each discovery, and a chain of events the player must complete by linking evidence together.
Piece by piece, you’ll reconstruct the truth behind each case.

Your original concept really stands out — the evolving matrix combined with reconstructing the event
timeline feels fresh and cerebral, like a hybrid between Return of the Obra Dinn and Her Story.
